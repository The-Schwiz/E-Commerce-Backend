# E Commerce Backend

## Description

An application built using Express.js, Seqeulize, MySQL2, and more, to modify the database of an ecommerce website using GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT routes, so managers can keep their inventories up to date. 

## Use

Users will need to copy the code into their own local studio and run "npm install" in the CLI to get all dependencies installed. 

Users will then run their SQL server and login, then SOURCE the db. 

After, the user will enter "node run seed" to seed the data. 

User can then enter "npm start" to initialize the application.
